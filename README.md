### About Me

Hi!  My name is Nelson, and I'm currently a full stack web developer (with front-end focus) who is very familiar with HTML, CSS, JavaScript/TypeScript, React.js, Redux,  Node.js, SQL, and Express.js

⏫ My Journey

Years of hard work, and reevaluation have come to a head, and have spoken.  
Downtime due to quarantine helped me pick up an interest in web development and is what ultimately lead to my decision of pursuing an education and career based in it - and I haven't looked back.  

I'm truly grateful for the oppurtunity of being able to finally pursue a stable profession, and am even more grateful that I truly enjoy the satisfaction that comes with development and coding in general.  

Making things that work, is ✨ **AWESOME**. ✨


Quick Trivia about Me:

- 🏞 I lived in California on my own for about 4 years but just recently moved back to New York
- 🌲 I love nature, and landscapes
- 🎮 I love playing Xbox, and video games in general to be honest
- ⚔️  I love shonen anime
- 🔉 I had a quick speaking role in the Netflix show "Dead to Me"
