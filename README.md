### About Me

Hi!  My name is Nelson, and I'm currently a full stack web developer who is currently very familiar with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React.js, Node.js, SQL, and Express.js

^ My Journey

Years of hard work, and reevaluation have come to a head, and have spoken.  
Downtime due to quarantine helped me pick up an interest in web development and is what ultimately lead to my decision of pursuing an education and career based in it - and I haven't looked back.  

I'm truly grateful for the oppurtunity of being able to finally pursue a stable career choice, and am even more grateful that I truly enjoy the satisfaction that comes with development and coding in general.  

Making things that work, is **AWESOME**.
